This project focuses on implementing a predictive maintenance system for Railways using 
IoT, Advanced Machine learning & Deep learning techniques. The system aims to improve 
the reliability and efficiency of the railway system by collecting data from various sensors on 
railway equipment and infrastructure, such as vibration sensors on trains, track inspection 
sensors, cameras, and other sensors used for monitoring infrastructure and traffic, and 
maintenance and repair history data. The collected data will be then cleaned & analyzed 
using machine learning algorithms such as anomaly detection, regression, time-series 
forecasting, PCA, random forest & deep learning algorithms like RNNs, CNNs, 
Autoencoders, GANs, and LSTM to predict potential failures and identify patterns that 
indicate when maintenance is needed. The proposed system can effectively predict potential 
failures and schedule maintenance before time & also helps to improve safety by identifying 
potential hazards before they occur. This project also highlights the need of developing a 
user-friendly interface to allow railway operators to easily monitor and manage the predictive 
maintenance system.
